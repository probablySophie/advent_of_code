With Rust 🦀!

This is a big Repo with multiple years, so you'll need to go into the year's folder and then just `cargo run`!

### Times:

| Day  | Pre-Calc | Part 1   | Part 2     | Total      |

| 7    | 1.81ms   | 14.87ms  | `1.86s`    | `1.88s`    |
| 8    | 98.73µs  | 5.99ms   | 5.35ms     | 11.44ms    |
| 9    | 40.00ns  | 97.14ms  | `256.14ms` | `353.29ms` |
| 10   | 125.65µs | 1.67ms   | 1.62ms     | 3.41ms     |

*Entire runtime: 4.64s*

*Day `e` is an empty day for cloning into more days*  
*Pre-Calc is any code that is run before part 1 & 2 are run - generally input parsing*  
***All of these times are single-run times (not multi-run averages), so they will differ slightly from test to test***

### TODO:

* Get everyone's part 1 & 2 below 200ms
