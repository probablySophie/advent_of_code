This is a big Repo with multiple years, so you'll need to go into the year's folder and then just `cargo run`!

### TODO:

* A bench-marking function in each day
	* Have it print into a pretty table!
	* Have it highlight bad times
	* Print into a markdown-ready table?
* Figure out a macro that allows for just one set of calls, but that also makes the bench-marking
* Day 6 part 2 is *slow* and could be fixed up with a point map
* Day 7 part 2 is *slow*
